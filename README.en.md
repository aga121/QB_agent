# Queen_Bee / QB_agent

[简体中文](README.md) | [English](README.en.md)

## Overview

This is a Web-based agent platform built on a Claude agent core. It delivers strong performance and high task completion efficiency, with robust compatibility for complex enterprise workflows. Hardware costs are minimized: 16GB of memory can support thousands of concurrent users, making it ideal for SMBs that want an intelligent hub across the business without heavy infrastructure spend. The system leverages Linux UID/GID and cgroup2, combined with an algorithmic Bash-wrapping mechanism to achieve sandbox isolation under 1MB of memory, delivering low cost with safety and stability. For compute, in non-private deployments it uses GLM Coding to drive the model, keeping agent capability while reducing hardware and compute costs so a 1,000-employee company can operate for just a few hundred to a few thousand RMB per month. Built-in agent reclamation, algorithm optimizations, and a carefully designed sandbox enable 1,000 commercial users with only a few hundred RMB in hardware cost and very modest compute, supporting daily work at scale. This is genuinely striking.
